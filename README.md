## Summarizes the analysis
* Our analyses' goal was to look at how students performed at various schools within the district, with a particular emphasis on stats like average math and reading test scores and the proportion of students who passed these courses. We dug deep into the information, categorizing it according to each school's performance, spending per student level, size, and type of school.

* Total schools:**
This analysis included the school_count schools' performance measures.

* Total students:**
To create a complete picture of the district's academic nature, we combined the data from student_count students.

* Total budget:**
The district's money spent on education totaled total_budget.

* Academic performance:**
The district's students earned average reading and math scores of average_reading_score and average_math_score, respectively. Furthermore, passing_math_percentage and passing_reading_percentage were the percentages of students who demonstrated math and reading proficiency. Importantly, the proportion of students who showed ability in both courses was recorded as % passing overall.

## conclusions or comparisons
1. Importance of Budget on Academic Performance:**
Surprisingly, schools with lower spending per student (that is, $585 and less) had better academic outcomes in terms of average scores and passing rates than schools with higher spending per student spending (above $645). This means that higher investment does not necessarily means better academic performance.

2. School Size Is Important:**
Compared to larger schools (2000-5000 students), small to medium-sized schools (less than 2000 students) showed noticeably greater passing rates in both courses. This implies that in larger schools, individual student performance may be negatively affected, maybe as a result of elements like less individualized attention, or other difficulties arising from managing larger student populations.
